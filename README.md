# Hall of Fame
We have designed A Hall of Fame which have been designed like a replica of our universe and here shines the bright names of our greatest Astronauts of time.
All the Astronauts in this hall of fame have been taken from the hall of fame at keneddy space centre's visitor complex.
The major part of our hall of fame is that it is interactive and all the Astronauts names are clickable. The user can click on any of the Astronaut and the centre stage will display 3d model of the Astronaut along with the details of the missions led by them
